Component Based Styling - Tuesday 2
    - Blogs listed under gsans
    - @HostBinding (Styling) - Programatically add a style to a Component. Could use this for loader?
    - Shadow DOM is the Angular feature that gives components their style encapsulation
        - Emulated, Native, None (to disable Shadow DOM)
    - Container Styling (:host)
    - Context Styling (:host-context) - Allows you to style a container above the component you're working on
        - :host-context(.theme) { color: red; }
    - Overriding Styles (>>>) Anti-pattern - Usually bad practice. Breaks Shadow DOM. Can ba used to make changes to third party libraries like d3 or Material Design
    - Renderer2 allows you to access elementRef styles without a browser. Works outside of traditional browsers
    - ng-content - will find html tags passed in to a component and render them based on the select="<passed value>"
